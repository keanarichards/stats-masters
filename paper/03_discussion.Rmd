Overall, we found that voice pitch has a significant effect upon perceived threat, where lower-pitched voices were rated as more threatening compared to their higher-pitched counterparts, replicating previous literature on this topic [@Hodges-Simeon2014]. We also found an unexpected effect of race upon leadership, where Black men were rated significantly higher on perceived leadership compared to White men. This finding contradicted our expectations, since most other research on this topic suggests that White men are prototypical leaders and are much more likely to be rated higher on perceived leadership than other social groups [@Rosette2008]. Our original primary hypotheses were not supported, since we did not find the expected interaction effects of voice pitch and race on perceived threat or perceived leadership. With regards to our secondary hypotheses, we find support for our prediction that perceived trustworthiness and perceived dominance would be related to perceived threat in the expected directions. Specifically, perceived trustworthiness was negatively related to perceived threat and perceived dominance was positively related to perceived threat across all conditions. This aligns with previous research examining the effect of the facial dominance and trustworthiness that combine to affect perceived threat [@Oosterhof2008], but no studies have examined this relationship based upon vocal characteristics and race before. Therefore, our study provides preliminary support for the notion that the observed effects of facial trustworthiness and dominance on threat can be generalized to other personal characteristics (i.e., the voice).

Regarding our other secondary hypotheses, we found a significant effect of race upon perceived trustworthiness, but in the opposite direction of our expectations, where Black men were rated as significantly more trustworthy compared to White men. Most of the literature in this domain suggests that Black men are perceived as less trustworthy [@Stanley2012; @Stanley2011], largely because of negative stereotypes that are applied to their social category. Additionally, we found the expected effect of voice pitch on perceived dominance. 

In future research, we intend to address several limitations in our methodology that may have affected our results. Specifically, we only used White male voices, most of whom were graduate students at the University of Pennsylvania, which allowed us to have a relatively homogeneous sample of stimuli. Although race cannot be detected from the voice, SES and education levels are reflected by vocal characteristics, so it is entirely possible that participants were expecting the stereotypical Black names (which tend to be associated with low SES) to have African American vernacular [@Labov2010]. However, the voices we used as stimuli were from individuals that were attaining a much higher standard of education (PhD students) compared to the average individual, which may be obvious in their speech patterns. Additionally, the threat item was not situated in any context (i.e., participants were not provided any background as to why the voices should be perceived as threatening), and it is possible that the ratings reflected different forms of perceived threat (i.e., physical threat, threat to resources, etc.). We observed the expected effect of voice pitch upon perceived threat and threat potential, which may reflect an innate understanding of how sounds can convey threat, which is observed even in infancy (e.g., larger objects produce a lower pitch) [@Vestergaard2009]. On the other hand, race is not an evolutionarily-relevant coalitional cue, but instead is constructed as a cue of coalitional alliances through ecological conditions [@Kurzban2001], so it is unlikely that the manipulation of race elicited the perceptions of threat to the same degree as the voice manipulations. Since the study was conducted online and approximately half of the participants indicated that they listened to the recordings through speakers, it is also possible that there may have been differences in the listening environment that prevented participants from picking up on the differences in our voice pitch manipulations. Finally, we did not ask participants whether they thought the study was real, which may have provided more information about our observed results, since it is entirely possible that participants answered the suspicion check to align with the cover story because they thought it might have been an attention check.

It is imperative that future research within this domain attempts to address some of these limitations and determine whether the results are generalizable and replicable. Future studies should recruit a more diverse sample for vocal stimuli, including women and people from different racial groups and education levels. It would be useful to ask participants to guess which race and education level each voice represents to determine whether these characteristics will moderate the relationship between the independent variables and perceived leadership. Other studies [@Hester2018] have included endorsement of stereotypes as a moderator for explaining higher ratings on stereotype-consistent items, which would be valuable in future extensions of this research. Finally, reversing the playback of the recordings may allow us to reduce the effects of speech content and vernacular upon participants' ratings.

It will also be important to disentangle the possible explanations for our unexpected effect of race upon perceived leadership. There are a few possible explanations for these results, which we will discuss briefly, along with ways to address these possible explanations in future research. First, social demand effects are always a concern when running within-subjects studies about race, because people are averse to being considered biased against Black people. When participants were presented 2 White names and 2 Black names (in a random order), it is entirely possible that they guessed that the study was focused on perceptions based upon race. Although we included a suspicion check and excluded participants based upon stringent criteria, the suspicion check may have biased participants to indicate that they were not suspicious. Specifically, they had to type in a text entry box if they were suspicious about the hypotheses, whereas they could simply select a multiple-choice option to indicate that they were not aware of the hypotheses. As a result, participants may have chosen the easier multiple-choice option on the suspicion check instead of choosing to type in their actual prediction of the purpose of the study. Future research can overcome social demand effects by offering to pay participants to tell the truth. 

Another potential explanation for our unexpected results is contrast effects, which are based upon the shifting stereotypes model [@Biernat1991]. This model posits that an individual will judge others on stereotype-relevant dimensions relative to other individuals within their social category. In the case of our study, the order of presentation of the name and voice stimuli may have affected the outcomes, since the stereotypical Black names were presented before the voices. This may have preempted them to expect a voice that sounded relatively uneducated. Previous research shows that the voice can convey SES and education levels [@Kreiman2011], so it is entirely possible that participants used this information in their assessments of the individuals in the recordings. Since the individuals that we recruited for our voice stimuli were generally well-educated (University of Pennsylvania graduate students and upper-level undergraduates) relative to the general population, the Black voices might have exceeded their low expectations, eliciting higher ratings. On the contrary, White men tend to have positive stereotypes attributed to them regarding their leadership ability [@Rosette2008], so the baseline expectations for the White voices were relatively high, which may have also contributed to the effect of race upon perceived leadership ability. Future studies should use more objective measures of leadership, since contrast effects are more likely to appear when participants are rating stimuli on subjective measures (e.g., Likert-type items) because these ratings may vary across contexts, while objective measures are consistent, regardless of the target, the perceiver, or immediate environmental influences [@Biernat2003]. If future studies replicate the current study design but replace the leadership composite with objective measures and do not find a similar effect of race upon leadership, this will provide support for contrast effects upon our results.

The final explanation that we encourage future researchers to explore is the possibility that Black men were rated higher on leadership because, in the absence of threat, they may benefit from stereotypes that typically attribute dominance and aggressiveness to their social group [@Devine1995]. Dominance and aggressiveness were invaluable characteristics for leaders throughout our evolutionary history who needed to be successful during lethal inter-group conflicts and dangerous hunting sessions [@VanVugt2008]. Therefore, any personal characteristics that are perceived as more dominant or aggressive may increase perceived leadership ability, even though these traits may not accurately reflect leadership ability in the modern day [@Klofstad2018; @Li2017]. In this way, Black men might have been rated as better leaders because they were attributed dominance and aggressiveness to a greater degree than White men based upon stereotypes. 

Future extensions of this research will be fruitful in helping us fully understand the complex interplay of vocal characteristics and racial stereotypes in affecting person perception. As other research has demonstrated, Black men are more likely to be perceived as threatening [@Trawalter2008; @Wilson2017], which can be detrimental to their success in leadership positions when they are typically the minority in the corporate world. There is preliminary evidence in support of the concept that Black men that have disarming mechanisms may benefit from these personal characteristics in leadership positions [@Hester2018; @Livingston2009; @Wilson2017]. Although the current study did not find the expected interaction effects of voice pitch and race upon perceived threat and leadership, there is still room for improvement in the methodological design and we encourage future researchers to extend this line of work to explore possible explanations further.

This line of work is important in helping us disentangle the personal characteristics that have a major effect upon person perception. Since we are incapable of reading others' minds to assess their intentions, we usually must make judgments of their character based upon their personal characteristics, even if these traits may not always be linked to their trustworthiness and/or threat potential. In this way, stereotypes about their group (based upon their observable characteristics that cue group membership) and their personal characteristics that cue their ability to act upon any threatening intentions combine to predict trust towards that person.

The stereotype that Black people are a threat to physical safety and personal property has permeated largely because race and ecology are confounded in the United States, such that Black people are more likely to be impoverished, which is intricately linked with crime risk [@Williams1997; @Williams2016]. Along these lines, Black people are overrepresented in certain contexts that link them with threat to physical safety (e.g., prisons) [@Mauer2007; @Roberts2004]. Over time, Americans began to associate crime with any individuals categorized as Black [@Quillian2001]. These stereotypes are especially likely to be spread in the modern context, since there are a multitude of technologies available for communicating with numerous individuals regardless of interpersonal distance, which encourages the uniform and rapid spread of information across a culture. Also, popular press facilitates this stereotyping by reporting racialized crime stories that strengthen the association between race and physical threat [@Dixon2007; @Gilliam1996]. Through these mechanisms, stereotypes have become ingrained in the public conscious in America today, and continue to affect how Black people are treated daily, even after explicit prejudice has become less socially acceptable [@Murphy2013]. Since many of the stereotypes in America are rooted in protracted racial tensions throughout history, any intervention to reduce these stereotypes must be comprehensive, targeting the many factors that contribute to stereotypes about Black people. Specifically, it is possible that the voice may serve as a potent disarming mechanism that can reduce perceived threat in Black men, which we explored through the current study. This research provides an initial glimpse into how certain vocal characteristics can be affected by racial stereotypes, but future research needs to continue this line of work to enlighten us about the importance of nonverbal behavior in influencing perceptions of, and in turn, behavior towards minority individuals.
